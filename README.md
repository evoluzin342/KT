Architecture Patterns around Angular



-Every Application contains two layers. 
           -view layer(render the view based on the data we have in controller)
           -service layer and also known as the data layer(fetch the data from the database and update the data in the controller)

How should we design the service layer ?
-Should we use a store concept?
-We can use the patterns?
in this session we can discuss NgRx,Flux pattern.
